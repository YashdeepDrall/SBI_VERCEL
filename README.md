# SBI Chatbot

This project is scoped for SBI fraud investigation workflows and now runs as a single FastAPI service with a browser-based chat UI.

- Backend: FastAPI APIs for login, fraud analysis, SOP retrieval, and document download
- Frontend: same-origin web UI served from the FastAPI app root
- Knowledge base: `banks/sbi/SBI_SOP.pdf`
- Database: currently replaced with in-memory runtime state
- RAG: Gemini embeddings plus Gemini answer generation through API calls
- Vector storage: document chunk embeddings are cached locally on disk and reused for unchanged PDFs

## Environment

Set these values in `.env` or your deployment environment:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key`
- `GEMINI_GENERATION_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`
- `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=gemini-embedding-2-preview`

Optional tuning:

- `GEMINI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768`
- `RAG_TOP_K=4`
- `RAG_MIN_SIMILARITY=0.2`

The app writes its reusable local vector cache to `local_cache/sbi_vectors.json`.

## Local Run

1. Install packages from `requirements.txt`
2. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. Start the FastAPI app:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Default local login:

- User ID: `sbi001`
- Password: `0000`

## Vercel Deploy

This repo is now prepared for a single Vercel project and a single public URL.

How it works on Vercel:

- `index.py` exposes the FastAPI app as the Vercel Python entrypoint
- `public/index.html` is served from the FastAPI root so the chatbot opens directly on the same domain
- the browser keeps the conversation step state and sends it back with each request, which avoids relying on server memory across Vercel function invocations
- `scripts/precompute_vectors.py` runs during the Vercel build so the SOP vector cache is ready in the deployed bundle

Files used for Vercel:

- `index.py`
- `vercel.json`
- `scripts/precompute_vectors.py`
- `public/index.html`

How to deploy on Vercel:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import the repo into Vercel as one project.
3. Add the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
4. Deploy.
5. Open the generated Vercel URL and log in with:
   - User ID: `sbi001`
   - Password: `0000`

## Notes

- This repo is now using the Vercel single-service path only.
